## Sample characteristics

For continuous or ordinal variables, the "mean" column provides the mean
and the "sd/%" column the standard deviation of the variable.
For categorical variables, the "mean" column provides the number
of samples with the given "value" and the
"sd/%" column the percentage of samples with the given "value".
